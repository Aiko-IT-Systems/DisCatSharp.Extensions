# Simple Music Commands

## What is this?

This extensions turns your DisCatSharp bot into a music bot, without the trouble of writing each command.

All you need to do is to follow the setup for Lavalink mentioned in https://docs.dcs.aitsys.dev/articles/modules/audio/lavalink_v4/docker.

## Quick run-down

```cs
DiscordClient client;

// Initiate the application commands module first

// Initiate the simple music commands module
client.UseSimpleMusicCommands(new LavalinkConfiguration());

// Register the music commands
var extension = await Client.GetSimpleMusicCommandsExtension();
extension.RegisterMusicCommands();

// Connect the discord client first!
await client.ConnectAsync();

// Connect the extension
await extension.ConnectAsync();
```

## And that does?

It creates and handles application commands for your bot, all by itself ðŸ’•
